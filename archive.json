I have read the whole\n    document but I didn\u2019t find them.\n  * [x] Like ReIM, this document seems to suffer from an \"unlimited scope\"\n    problem. IMO, too much emphasis is placed on the idea that the\n    interaction can be generalised to other CMs. This seems an even\n    more radical assumption here because, unlike ReIM, this\n    specification provides a real wire protocol rather than a set of\n    interaction models.  As such, it should clearly explain how this\n    idea is realised.\n\n* [x] Ignorant question: What does \"providing the same protected\n  capabilities as TPMs\" mean concretely?  Would a DICE RoT be considered\n  equivalent?\n\n## \u00a71\n\n* [x] s/Conceptional/Conceptual/ :-)\n\n* [x] \"[RFC9683] and [RFC9684] define the operational prerequisites and a\n  YANG Model for the acquisition of Evidence and other Conceptional\n  Messages [...]\"\n  * [x] Skimming RFC968[34], there is no mention of \"other conceptual\n    messages\"; the scope seems to be quite rigidly confined to\n    attestation evidence.\n\n* [x] In general, whenever citing ReIM, 9334, etc. increase precision: use\n  \"Section X of Y\" whenever possible.\n\n* [x] \"This memo specifies a YANG augment\"\n  * [x] \"augment\" is the concrete YANG statement... in this context\n    \"augmentation\" may be more appropriate.\n\n* [x] \"or its [the nonce\u2019s] freshness characteristics.\"\n  * [x] Unclear what \"freshness characteristics\" is supposed to mean.\n    Please could you clarify?\n\n* [x] \"Two complementary methods [...]\"\n  * [x] Is \"complementary\" the right word? Are they supposed to be used\n    together?  If not, use \"alternative methods\" instead?\n\n* [x] \"In consequence, in some usage scenarios the timing considerations for\n  freshness [RFC9334] might have to be updated in some regular interval.\n  Analogously, there are can be additional methods that are not describe\n  by but nevertheless supported by this document.\"\n  * [x] The grammar seems a be buggy.  It's unclear to me what this\n    paragraph is supposed to mean.\n\n## \u00a73.1\n\nSimilar to reading a QFT textbook, I approached this section with my\nheart filled with expectation of enlightment, but I only found more\nconfusion ;-)\n\n* [x] The sequence diagram needs some attention: a diagram should be\nself-explanatory, but parameter names appear and disappear from one\nmessage to the next.  This lack of correlation makes it impossible to\nfollow without referring to the subsequent prose.\nIt's not a fatal flaw, but it's still slightly annoying. ;-)\n\n* [x] \"a set of PCRs of interest which the wants to appraise\"\n  * add \"[...] the RP/Verifier wants [...]\"\n\n* [x] \"a handle (see Section 6. in\n  [I-D.ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models], which is either the\n  initially received nonce or a more recently received Epoch ID\"\n  * Not sure how \"a more recently received Epoch ID\" is conveyed?\n  * Also, the use of parentheses is broken in this bullet point\n\n* [x] \"is elaborated on in the follow section Section 3.2.\"\n  * remove \"follow section\"\n\n* [x] unclear what \"acquire a new time synchronisation\" means.  Please\n  rephrase using simpler terms.\n\n## \u00a73.2.2\n\n* [x] s/countersr/counters/\n\n## \u00a74.3.1\n\n* [x] s/emmitted/emitted/\n\n## \u00a74.5\n\n* [x] The reference [KGV] doesn't seem to make sense\n\n## \u00a78\n\n* [x] The security considerations look very (too?) thin.  While it's great to\nrefer to the baseline specs, it seems odd that no further security\nconsiderations are introduced by this augmentation.  For example, the\nfreshness-related aspects covered in \u00a73.2 seem relevant to security, yet\nthey are not mentioned at all (not even by reference).  In particular,\ncorrectly sizing the heartbeat would seem an interesting topic to\nexplore.\nYou may also wish to discuss the attack surface that is potentially\nenabled in a pub-sub scope, e.g.:\n  * [x] DoS the node via oversubscription/resource exhaustion\n  * [x] Amplification attacks (AFAIU, the notifications include an\n    ever-increasing event log (\u00a73.1 says: \"log entries [...] since\n    boot\")\n\n## Final words\n\n* [ ] One final consideration is that the document would benefit from a\nback-to-back edit to improve its readability, including the prose and\ndiagrams.",

A TPM-equivalent has various protected capabilities, e.g., storing shielded secrets that can only be operated on and to provide integrity registers (the TPM's PCRs). My assumption is that RFC9684 and this I-D can be adapted to support DICE, but it is not in the current scope and both phrasing as well as data structures are tailored towards TPMs.",

In RATS, the Conceptional Messages defined can potentially be subscribed to. Specifically, the YANG module defined in this document augments the YANG module for TPM-based Challenge-Response based Remote Attestation (CHARRA) to allow for subscription to the Conceptual Message type Evidence. Additionally, this memo provides the methods and means to define additional Event Streams for other Conceptual Messages than Evidence as illustrated in the RATS Architecture, e.g., Attestation Results, Endorsements, or Event Logs. The module defined requires at least one TPM 1.2, TPM 2.0, or equivalent hardware implementation providing the same protected capabilities as TPMs to be available in the Attester the YANG server is running on.\r\n```",

This new Event Stream is defined in this document and exists upon the producer of Conceptual Messages (the publisher). In the case of a Verifier's subscription to an Attester's Evidence, the Attester will continuously stream a requested set of freshly generated Evidence to the subscribing Verifier. For example, when a network device's Evidence changes after the occurrence of events, such as booting, updating, control unit fall-over, plugging in or out forwarding units, being attacked, or certificate lifetime change, the network device will generate fresh Evidence available to the subscribing Verifier.\r\n```",
